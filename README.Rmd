# covidQuarantineViz

`covidQuarantineViz` is an R package that turns the analysis from ETC5523 
Assignments 1–3 into an interactive Shiny app and reproducible code.

This package was developed as part of **ETC5523 Assignment 4: Turning analysis
interactive**. It bundles simulation outputs from the COVIDQuarantine model and
provides both reproducible code and a Shiny app so that the analysis from
Assignments 1–3 can be explored in an interactive way.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-DhruvGal")
